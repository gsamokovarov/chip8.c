bq. CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. Initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s, it allowed video games to be easily programmable.

h2. Build

Running @cmake .@ at the project root directory will result in a lot of cruft files needed by the CMake build process. A better idea is to run:

<pre>
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
</pre>

That will keep the CMake specific files in a convinient location.

Once the CMake files are generated, running @make@ will build the interpreter and you can use @make install@ to install it.

h2. Install

Installing source packages with `make install` is not always a great idea. If you are running some Unix flavour you may want to utilize your system packaging tools. An utility named "CheckInstall":http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/ is pretty convinient in those situations. You can use it to generate and install a package, that is suitible for you. This package will be named @chip8.c@ and will be easily uninstallable through your package system.

I'm going to guide you through the process of installing "CheckInstall":http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/ on Ubuntu Linux. The process will be similar for other Linux distributions or your favorite Unix-like operating system.

h3. CheckInstall

On Ubuntu Linux "CheckInstall":http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/ is not installed by the default and you can install it with:

<code>
sudo apt-get install checkinstall
</code>

Asuming that you have already built the project in the @build@ directory, run:

<code>
sudo checkinstall --pkgname=chip8.c
</code>

Just follow the instructions and if everything went successful, you should see a message like the following:

<pre>
**********************************************************************

 Done. The new package has been installed and saved to

 /home/user/chip8.c/build/chip8.c_20130428-1_amd64.deb

 You can remove it from your system anytime using:

      dpkg -r chip8.c

h2. Usage

p. The CHIP-8 uses a hexadecimal keyboard, which maps rather well to the layout of the current generation keyboard numeric pad.

||                  <kbd>C</kbd> | <kbd>D</kbd> |    <kbd>E</kbd> |
|    <kbd>1</kbd> | <kbd>2</kbd> | <kbd>3</kbd> |/2. <kbd>F</kbd> |
|    <kbd>4</kbd> | <kbd>5</kbd> | <kbd>6</kbd> |
|    <kbd>7</kbd> | <kbd>8</kbd> | <kbd>9</kbd> |/2. <kbd>B</kbd> |
|\2. <kbd>A</kbd> | <kbd>0</kbd> |

p. Use following keys to reset or quit the emulator.

|_. Key                |_.  Action |
| <kbd>Backspace</kbd> | Reset     |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd>    | Quit      |
